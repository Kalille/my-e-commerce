DESCRIPTION

Gamers conquest is ecommerce web page I created which allows users to browse and shop alot of the latest games.
It was built using Ruby on Rails version 2.7.4 for the backend and React frontend, Third party API provided by best buy, React bootstrap and emailjs.



SETUP

To run this app:

bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed (backend)
npm install --prefix client


REFLECTIONS

My goals were to:

Use the full CRUD actions on at least one model

Allow user to be able to browse items

Allow user to add and delete items to a cart

Allow the user to checkout their items

Allow the user to add, delete and update comments on products

Use has_many through relations between models

Create more than 3 routes

Add emailjs to send confirmation email to user
